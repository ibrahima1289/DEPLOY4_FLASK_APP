# DEPLOY4_FLASK_APP

Deployment 4-1 - Url Shortener using Flask

Goal for this deployment: 
The goal for this deployment is to deploy a url-shortener app using AWS Beanstalk and Jenkins. 

Step 1: Forked this repo (https://github.com/kura-labs-org/DEPLOY04_FLASK_APP) to have a
copy of the url-shortner application.
All the source codes are in the repository DEPLOY4_FLASK_APP.

Followed the steps provided from this pdf document link to set up the AWS Beanstalk	and Jenkins. 
https://github.com/kura-labs-org/DEPLOY4_FLASK_APP/blob/main/Deployment%204.pdf


Step 2: Removed the README.md and Deployment4.pdf instructions from your forked repo
before I start the build in Jenkins.

Created a  requirements.txt file that is used for specifying what python packages are required to run the project. 

Below is the command for the setup on VS code.

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt

Step 3: Take a screenshot of the url-shortner home page and add the screenshot to your
screenshot file.
